PC:
	Add the equipment slots - PRESENT, BUT UNSURE IF IT'S RIGHT APPROACH.
		WEAPON - a
		OFFHAND - b
		RANGED - c
		ARMOR - d
		HELMET - e
		CLOAK - f
		GLOVES - g
		BOOTS - h

	Add the 10 carry slots (0-9) - PRESENT AS OBJECT VECTOR
	Default Hitpoints - SET AS 100 

MONSTERS: (Mainly old stuff that didn't get implemented)
	Dumb, non-telepathic paths. (OLD STUFF)
	Dumb, telepathic paths. (OLD STUFF)
	Smart, non-telepathic paths. (OLD STUFF) - Sorta works, but bogs the game down to oblivion.
		Going to switch to a dumb, non-telepathic path for this assignment.

MENUS/PROMPTS:
	Equipment Menu - NO LISTING YET, BUT WINDOW IS THERE.
	Backpack Menu - SHOULD WORK.
	"Are you sure?" Prompt - Works for the exit.
	Status ticker?
	
GAMEPLAY:
	Implement new control scheme: - FINISHED
		w - Wear an item.
		t - Take off item. 
		d - Drop item. - Works Fully
		x - Expunge Item. - Works Fully
	Implement Look Mode, if time allows. (OLD STUFF)
	Make it so that items are picked up from the tile. - WORKS.

CHARACTER CONTROL: - CHANGED

COMBAT SYSTEM:
	NPCs no longer kill NPCs - This is taken care of.
		Instead, move the NPC in a random direction. - Changed to swap method. Should work.
	PC-NPC Combat initiated by attempts to move into each other's cell. - Works, I think.
	All Attempted Attacks Connect - Hard to tell.
	When attack connects, -It's coded properly, but hard to tell if it's working.
		damage is done by rolling dice, totalling, and deducting from other's HP
			NPCs only have 1 damage dice
			PCs have bare hand and weapon.
		If hitpoints of character < 0. Character.alive = 0.
			PC.alive = 0 causes game to end, as usual.

OVERHAULS:
	See about fixing the character class to actually use inheritance. - I THINK I TOOK CARE OF THIS.
		This may simplify things a lot.

BUGS:
	Double Free or Corruption related to Game:187 - Fixed.
	Fix the command line args, if not fixed - Fixed I think.
	Displayed Dice Values on menus are not correct at all.
		The actual values though are entirely correct.
	
NOTES:
	Include full control scheme in Readme.
