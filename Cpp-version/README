Assignment 1.09 - Loading Monster and Object Definitions (Now in Color!)

Does it work? - I believe so

How to make it work:
	- Run the program by using ./dungeon <number of monsters> <number of objects>
	- There's some other command line utils, but they don't work as of right now.
	
Code locations:
	- display.hpp/.cpp
		- Contains a new method: redraw_with_templates
			- This method fully supports the parsed in character data
			- It also is able to print everything in specific colors.
	- game.hpp/.cpp
		- Contains a new constructor that can handle the object and monster templates
			- Parsing for this takes place in the second constructor.
			- it is Game::Game(int npcs, int objs) & can be found at lines 84-179.
	- dungeon.cpp
		- Holds the main calling code to the new functions for template-based displays.
		- Code to run the game's display can be found at either:
			- Lines 21-47
			- Lines 90-111
		
Notes:
	- The game is still not functioning properly at this point due to an error in the
	new turn system. I am working on this and advise that the game not be played for now.
	Besides, the save/load system doesn't do anything yet. This is due to me rewriting the
	entire game in C++, which has been a longer task than expected, but is turning out nicely.
