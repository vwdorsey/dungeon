Assignment 1.08 - Parsing Object Definitions

Sunday, 4/12
	
	- Started this assignment by doing a lot of cleanup and code rearrangement on the project
		- Makefile reimplemented to be far more generic and easier to manage.
		- Several structs made into classes
			- Includes object and character templates and the dice struct.
				- Object Template = obj_template.cpp/.hpp
				- Character Template = char_template.cpp/.hpp
				- Dice = dice.cpp/.hpp
			- Also involves a new Object and Character class
				- Object = object.cpp/.hpp
				- Character = character.cpp/.hpp
			- This allowed me to move code around and make small, but useful functions for specific things.
			- Also cut down on the risk of circular includes.

Monday, 4/13

	- Spent most of today moving code into new classes/new locations
		- Created the Dice, Object, Obj_template, Character, and Char_template classes.
			- All of these have the same structure as the structs they're derived from
			- Only real differences are 
			 	- it's easy to call them 
			 	- I added utility functions to said classes to make them more useful.

Tuesday, 4/14

	- Continued and finished rewriting classes
		- Took care of the new Game constructor to make all the new characters and objects
		- Also added the color palattes to the display class and actually tested them
			- Made the old renderer look very interesting, but in a good way.

	- Implemented the new display function, redraw_with_template, to handle the color and sprites
		- Required a deviation from the original format 
			-Replacd the active screen char array with one made of containers
				- Container is draw_container and has 2 elements, a char for Sprite and a short for Color

Wednesday, 4/15 - Past Deadline
	
	- Worked on ironing out all the bugs that had been cropping up
		- Several prevalent ones were
			- Memory leaks, as usual
				- Fixed by examining code and Valgrind output
				- Main cause was simply forgetting to deallocate
				- There's about 230k-240k memory that isn't being dealloced by ncurses though
			- Changing something in one place and forgetting to do it elsewhere
				- This would really be due to being tired and trying to think about what I'm doing
				- The only way to fix this is to just track everything down and make changes
			- Object characters wouldn't display right
				- Most would be the same or the '*'/not valid character.
				- Type values would also be off the charts and not be useful
				- One Fix: Appearantly, code got deleted that set the sprite
					- This caused a method to determine the sprite to return a char/memory address to an unsigned int.
				- The other fix: Tried to set sprite = to character when I needed to return the character
					- Not sure what it was returning then. Memory Address perhaps
