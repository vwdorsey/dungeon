Assignment 1.10 - New Battle System and Interacting With Items

Wednesday, 4/22
	
	- Started this assignment by working on a few small bugfixes.
		- Mainly one related to 
	- Didn't have much time to work on this.
		- You try working on projects, other homework, and studying for several tests.

Thursday, 4/23

	- Redid some of the inheritance within the Character class
		- Made the Monster and PC subclasses to replace the Player and Monster Structs
		- Simplified the code structure
		- It also caused a large explosion of errors due to legacy code
		- This took quite a while to smooth out.
	- Rearranged the control scheme to accept the new commands
		- The keyboard control scheme was the most affected
		- A full config will be written in the readme.
		- All controls are present.

Friday, 4/24

	- Continued implementing the inheritance stuffs
		- I ended up needing to implement several new header files to eliminate circular includes
		- The point, room, and tile structs ended up getting moved to their own files.
			- This made the include structure a lot simpler to work with.
	- Sorted out all the menu functions and wrote the functions for the menus and prompts
		- This took quite a while to actually get figured out, as drawing took a while to figure out
		- It started with the "Are you sure?" exit prompt
			- I intended to use this far more than for exit, but it never got implemented further.
		- Implemented the backpack menu next, as it was easier to do.
			- Listing the items did crop up some issues, such as strange segfaults, but they cleaned up well.

Saturday, 4/25
	- Tried to get the 
	- Got the item pickup system working to a degree.
		- Item picking up was rather easy to implement with a vector
			- Just shifted it into the vector
			- Also had to do check to make sure no more than 10 items were in the vector
			- Tried with an array, but this caused issues
		- Item dropping was a bit interesting to implement.
			- Had to pull the item from the vector and put it in a temp object pointer
			- Then I shoved the pointer into the tile below the character
			- Also created a simple error message when a user tried to put two items on the same tile
				- My game doesn't support that for now.
		- Item expunging was rather easy
	- Got some of the combat system working, but it's hard to tell if it works
		- This is due to the faulty pathfinding
			- I did try to get the smart monster pathfinding working, but it didn't go well
			- Decided to implement something to make the pathfinder simple enough to make the monsters come close.
	- Wrote this Changelog and Readme.
	
Major bugs for this run:
	- The dice values were improperly displayed for the longest time.
		- It took a long while to figure this one out
		- The dice printer seemed to have issues with getting the data out properly
		- I tried troubleshooting in various locations
		- Finally, the fix was to copy the damage dice to the object being built
		- It worked well after that, although it took forever to figure it out
	- Double free or corruption 
		- Another copying issue
		- It caused a lot of issues with destructors
		- Fixed by copying anything that needs memory allocations.
	- Command line args
		- Had to fix the command line args with string comparisons.
