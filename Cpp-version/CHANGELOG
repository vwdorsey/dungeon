Assignment 1.08 - Parsing Object Definitions

Monday, 4/6
	
	- Started the assignment by creating necessary structs, attributes, and function headers for 1.08
		- Created the struct obj_template
			- It contains all the information fields for 1.08
			- It should match the specification
		- Also created an defined

	- Worked on checking the 1.07 code, which it's based on, for memory leaks
		- Turns out that there was a memory leak related to the new objects
			-Basically, the program would create objects, but was unable to delete them
			-Spent around 2-3 hours working on this.
		- This issue has been fixed for the 1.07 code
			- Problem was that I created objects vs pointers to objects
			- Pointers are easy to delete/free, objects arent
			- Trying to delete said objects would cause Seg. Faults
