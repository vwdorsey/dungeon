CHANGELOG - ASSIGNMENT 1.03

2/26 - Project Start
    
    - Copied files from 1.04
            
    - Initial TODOs from 1.04
        - Need to make it so that the intelligence and telepathic things actually have an effect.
        - Need to integrate the paths so that the monsters, who are able to find the PC, can find the PC. 
        - Need to modify the runtime code so that, on the player's death or once all monsters die, the game will end. (RESOLVED 3/3)
        - Need to implement kill_all_characters so that it will fix all the memory losses due to not freeing the allocated characters. (RESOLVED 3/3)
       
2/28 
    
    - Performed work toward fixing issues from 1.04
        - Path finding
            - Made the Dijkstra function in path.c/h actually return a valid path from a current source to a destination (normally the player)
        - Character Modifications
            - Seperated the Character & Monster structs into different entities
            - Rewrote the entire move_character function to move it away from only 1 step in 8 directions to just entering the difference in position
            
3/1

    - Cleanup/Maintainance Tasks
        - Removed surpressed code from generation.c that has been present since 1.01.
            - Reason: Unnecessary and there are not plans to try and reincorporate it.
    
    - Added libs/defs.h
        - From now on, this file will contain any definitions for tiles, attributes, things that may change, etc.
        - This is more for simplicity sake, so I can change anything regarding the attributes or tiles quickly.
        - Also will hold parameters for the game, such as map size, max number of rooms, etc for easy changes.    
        
3/2

	- Fixed the path following capabilities of smart, telepathic monsters.
		- Although it takes forever for them to reach the character, they manage to.
		- Major bug occured when monster would reach character, as the path would end with 
	-
	- Bugfixing
		- Program wouldn't compile due to a lot of circular including
			- Fix: Add all structs to defs.h so that I wouldn't have to include so many things
			- Works reasonably well
		- A lot of typos, as usual.
			- Fix was to track them down, as expected.

3/3

	Created display.c/.h
		- It will contain pretty much any commands to make, update, and delete the ncurses display
		- Functions it currently contains:
